\subsection{StarBEAST2 correctly implements the multispecies coalescent}

New methods must be shown to be mathematically correct implementations of a
given model. One way to accomplish this for MCMC methods is to estimate
parameters from a prior distribution using the MCMC kernel, and also draw
independent samples from the same prior distribution by simulation. The
resulting parameter distributions should be identical if the implementation is
correct. We used this method to test the correctness of the novel features in
StarBEAST2; analytical population size integration, the four new operators, and
the species tree relaxed clock. Simulated and StarBEAST2 estimated distributions
were identical for species and gene tree topologies (Figure~S1,S2), species and
gene tree node heights (Figure~S3,S4) and gene tree branch rates (Figure~S5).
Those results support the mathematical correctness of StarBEAST2.

\subsection{New operators and analytical integration improve computational performance}

{Effect of operators, population size integration and clock models on
convergence. The performance of every combination of settings was measured when
applied to 22 \textit{Pseudacris} loci. Topology operators refers to the
replacement of na\"ive NNI and SPR operators with coordinated operators. Heights
operators refers to the addition of operators which make coordinated changes to
internal node heights. Uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) relaxed clocks were applied
to either each gene tree or to the species tree. Trimmed means of species tree
height estimated sample size (ESS) per hour were calculated from 32 independent
chains. 25\% trim was used to reduce the influence of outliers. All error bars
are 95\% confidence intervals calculated by bootstrapping.}
